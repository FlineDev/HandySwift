# HandySwift

The goal of this library is to **provide handy features** that didn't make it to the Swift standard library (yet) due to many different reasons.

If you like this, please also checkout [HandySwiftUI](https://github.com/FlineDev/HandySwitUI) for handy UI features that should have been part of the SwiftUI framework in the first place.


## Documentation

These two guides show you how you can make the most of HandySwift:
